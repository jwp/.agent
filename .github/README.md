## X-Agent-Links: TSV

Extraction and conversion tools for tabs and bookmarks.

Currently, the tooling only considers Mozilla and is intended to be adjusted as needed.
This is a toolbox, not a high-level application.

The primary target formt is TSV consisting of the fields(in order):

	1. Link
	2. Time Context (Date Added or First Visit or Nothing)
	3. Icon
	4. Title

Some of the tools are naive and will emit output that needs further processing by other tools.
