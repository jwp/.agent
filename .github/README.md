## X-Agent-Links: TSV

Extraction and conversion tools for tabs and bookmarks.

Currently, the tooling only considers Mozilla and is intended to be adjusted as needed.
This is a toolbox, not a high-level application.

The primary target format is TSV consisting of the fields(in order):

	1. Link
	2. Time Context (Date Added or First Visit or Nothing)
	3. Icon (Often a data URI)
	4. Title (An emoji laden mess)

Some of the tools are naive and will emit output that needs further processing by other tools.
